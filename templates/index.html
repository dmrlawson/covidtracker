    This is a collection of what I consider to be the most useful COVID-19 data
    for the UK. It is updated from the latest source data every 30 minutes.

  <h2>General Situation</h2>
  <p>
    Where data is likely to be incomplete due to reporting delays, a grey area
    is shown. Red vertical markers show the date when restrictions were imposed,
    green lines show restrictions being relaxed. Unless otherwise stated, trend
    lines are a 7-day rolling average.

  <h2>Unlocking Projections</h2>
  <p>The following graph shows the state of hospital admissions compared with
      the projections presented at the SAGE 93 meeting on 7 July 2021.
      It should be noted that <em>only the central estimate of each of the models
      is presented here</em>, and all of the models generated wide confidence intervals,
      which are not shown.
  </p>
  <p>These models are inherently sensitive to small changes in variables such as
      vaccine efficacy, cross-immunity, and immunity waning, as well as the public's behaviour.</p>
  <p>This data is presented on a logarithmic scale which allows better comparison of the trajectory of different models.</p>
