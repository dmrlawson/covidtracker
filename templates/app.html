    <p>This page provides some statistics on the <a href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/">NHS COVID-19 App</a>, which have been
        collected from the public API.</p>
    <p>This graph shows the number of exposure notification keys which have been announced as broadcast by people who
        were infected. Note that this is not the same as the number of people infected.</p>
    <div id="app_keys" class="graph"></div>
    <p>The app also fetches a list of "risky venues" to compare with its list of QR code checkins. This graph shows the
        number of risky venues by date of announcement:</p>
