  <h2>Hotspot Map</h2>
  <p>This map shows the per-capita prevalence of COVID-19 across the UK for the last seven days that reliable data
    is available. The data from the different nations are derived from different sources, and are not directly
    comparable. For this reason they are shown in different colours.</p>

  <p>This data <strong>does now include "pillar 2" tests for England</strong>. Weekly rates are taken from a spreadsheet
  published by Public Health England, history is not available, and the data is older than that from Wales and Scotland.
  For this reason, the data from the separate nations is shown in different colours.</p>

  <p>Please <a href="#sources">see below</a> for more information on the data sources used and their limitations.</p>

  <p>You can click on an area on the map to see the current numbers and a history of the last 45 days of daily cases.</p>
